# Propbability Theory

This repo contains some definitions from measure theory and their immediate results. 

The most important result in this repo is the [Radon-Nikodym theorem](https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/singular.lean#L479). 

Other important theorems include 
- the Hahn decomposition theorem
- the Jordan decomposition theorem
- the Lebesgue decomposition theorem
