The most important result in this repo is the [Radon-Nikodym theorem](https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/singular.lean#L479). 

Other important theorems include 
- the [Hahn decomposition theorem](https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/hahn.lean#L532)
- the [Jordan decomposition theorem](https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/singular.lean#L30)
