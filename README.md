# Propbability Theory

This repo contains some definitions from measure theory and their immediate results. 

The most important result in this repo is the Radon-Nikodym theorem (see [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/4435e909d7394707e958143ca914544c1cd9ee0c/src/measure_theory/decomposition/radon_nikodym.lean)). 

Other important theorems include 
- the Hahn decomposition theorem
- the Jordan decomposition theorem
- the Lebesgue decomposition theorem
